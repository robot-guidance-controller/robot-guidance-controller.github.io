    <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><br/>Observational study design and key findings from expert-led demonstrations. Top row: Four experimental conditions used to isolate guidance modalitiesâ€”reference trajectory (passive patient), verbal-only, physical-only, and combined guidance. Bottom row: Analysis reveals adaptive guidance patterns across compliance states. (a) Median physical force decreases as verbal and physical compliance together progressively increase. (b) Speaking frequency reduces from 1.77 to 0.36 words/second with higher verbal compliance. (c) Language content shifts from instructional (ratio 3.67) to encouraging (ratio 1.60) as verbal compliance improves. These patterns demonstrate how expert instructors naturally adapt both the intensity and nature of guidance based on learner compliance levels.</figcaption>
